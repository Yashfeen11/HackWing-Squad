# 🌊 Smart Water Leakage & Theft Detection System
### **HackWing – Round 2 Submission**


## 📌 Problem Statement
Water loss due to **leakage** and **unauthorized theft** is a critical challenge in modern urban infrastructure. Traditional systems are often reactive rather than proactive. 

**Our Goal:** Design an intelligent, scalable system that:
* 🛰️ **Simulates** realistic IoT water sensor data.
* 🧠 **Detects** anomalies (leakage/theft) using baseline logic.
* ⚠️ **Generates** real-time alerts.
* 📊 **Visualizes** system health via an intuitive dashboard.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
We have built a **modular, end-to-end architecture** that mimics a real-world utility grid. By utilizing a custom-built **Data Simulation Engine**, we can test complex scenarios without needing physical hardware.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This submission focuses on **robust architecture, data logic, and modular scalability** as per Round 2 requirements.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture
The system follows a linear, high-integrity pipeline:



1.  **Simulation Layer:** Generates flow and pressure data.
2.  **Processing Engine:** Establishes baselines and identifies deviations.
3.  **Classification Layer:** Categorizes events (Normal vs. Leak vs. Theft).
4.  **Presentation Layer:** Persistent storage in MongoDB and Live Dashboard.

# Decision Logic:
# - Leakage:
#   - High Flow Delta
#   - Drop in Pressure
# - Theft:
#   - High Flow Delta
#   - Consistent Pressure
# - Normal:
#   - Flow Delta within ±5% tolerance

# Stage 04: Storage
# Component: Data Storage
# Technical Logic:
# - Pushes processed data to MongoDB
# - Uses REST APIs
# - Ensures persistence for historical trend dashboards
